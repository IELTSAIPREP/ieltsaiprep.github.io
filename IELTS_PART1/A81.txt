books in 2014. This was the highest figure in the period.Women started off reading more books than men, but their 
numbers followed a different pattern. Between 2011 and 2012, there was an increase 
of 3000 from 5000 books to 8000 books, and then a gradual rise to 10000 books in 
2013. However, in 2014, their numbers fell back to 8000 again.Overall, there was a strong upward trend in the number of 
books read by men. Although women read more books than men in 2011, their reading 
fell to below the level of men in 2014.
