stages in its development: 1960, 1980 and 2000.In 1960, the hospital was built close to a main road and 
next to a shopping centre. A large area behind the hospital was turned into a car 
park, while the area behind the shopping centre was farmland.By 1980, the shopping centre had been demolished in order 
to make way for two additional hospital building which became a pharmacy and a cancer 
centre. Furthermore, the hospital gained the farmland and converted it into a nursing 
school.In 2000, the main hospital building remained unchanged but 
the cancer centre was extended to cover the entire nursing school. As a result of 
this, the original car park was divided into two so that it provided a smaller car 
park and a small nursing school.During this period, the hospital has increased in size and, 
in addition to a new nursing school, a cancer centre has been created and extended. 
Hence the capacity of the car park has been reduced by a half.
