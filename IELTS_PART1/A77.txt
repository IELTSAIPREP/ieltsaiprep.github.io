This report summarises information on the total number of students in the United Kingdom who gained qualifications for English Language Teachers in two academic years, 2007/8 and 2008/9, with specific focus on the number of male qualifiers.In both years, the total numbers of students remained the same, but there was a great difference between the numbers of male and female students who qualified. In 2007/8, out of a total of 32,930 students, only 24.7% were male. The percentage of males who qualified in 2008/9 was even lower. Out of a total of 32,945 students, only 22.7% of them were male. This is a drop of 2%.There was also a large difference in the qualifications that students studied for. Most students qualified with a TEFL certificate; this was true for male students. The number of students who qualified with the TEFL was roughly three times the number who qualified with a Cambridge UCLES CELTA or other degrees, although the total number of students qualifying with the TEFL dropped slightly, from 25,446 in 2007/8 to 24,917 a year later. There was a drop of 0.7% in the number of male students who gained this qualification.In general it can be seen that the number of males qualifying as English language teachers is vastly outnumbered by females and that the proportion of male qualifiers is gradually dropping.
