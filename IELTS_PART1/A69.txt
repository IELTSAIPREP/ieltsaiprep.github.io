becoming degraded in the world today. Globally, 65% of degradation is caused by 
too much animal grazing and tree clearance, constituting 35% and 30% respectively. 
A further 28% of global degradation is due to over-cultivation of crops. Other causes 
account for only 7% collectively.These causes affected different regions differently in the 
1990s, with Europe having as much as 9.8% of degradation due to deforestation, while 
the impact of this on Oceania and North America was minimal, with only 1.7% and 
0.2% of land affected respectively. Europe, with the highest overall percentage 
of land degraded (23%), also suffered from over-cultivation (7.7%) and over-grazing 
(5.5%). In contrast, Oceania had 13% of degraded farmland and this was mainly due 
to over-grazing (11.3%). North America had a lower proportion of degraded land at 
only 5%, and the main causes of this were over-cultivation (3.3%) and, to a lesser 
extent, over-grazing (1.5%).Overall, it is clear that Europe suffered more from farmland 
degradation than the other regions and the main causes there were deforestation 
and over-cultivation.
