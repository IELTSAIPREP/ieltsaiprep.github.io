The graph shows the number of hours per day on average that children spent watching television. The graph covers the period between 1950 and 2010.From 1950 to 1960, there was a modest rise in the average number of hours children spent in front of the television set. This was followed by a marked increase from approximately one hour to four hours of viewing per day among children between 1965 and 1982. Over the next five years, there was a decrease. However this trend proved negligible as the viewing figure then rose again marginally, and it reached a peak of over four hours in 1995.Between 1995 and 2010, there was another modest decline in the hours children spent watching television.Overall, it can be concluded that there has been a significant rise in television viewing over the sixty-year period, though there is some indication that this trend may be changing.
