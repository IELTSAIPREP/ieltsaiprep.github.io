Languages with the most native speakers

The table illustrates the number of native speakers of six 
languages as well as the number of speakers of these languages as an additional 
language. It is noticeable that the number of speakers of Mandarin Chinese is strikingly 
higher than the other languages with over one billion speakers.People who speak Mandarin largely speak it as a first language 
(900 million). In comparison to this only 190 million people speak Mandarin Chinese 
as an additional language. What is remarkable about English speakers is that the 
number of speakers of English as an additional language is higher than that of native 
speakers of English (603 and 339 million respectively).While the total number of Hindi speakers (490 million) is 
roughly equal to that of Spanish speakers (420 million); when it comes to speaking 
these languages as an additional language the number for Hindi is much higher (120 
million) than that for Spanish (70 million).Native speakers of Arabic and Portuguese are similar in 
number with 206 million and 203 million respectively. However, the number of Arabic 
speakers as an additional language (24 million) is almost 2.5 times higher than 
speakers of Portuguese as an additional language.
