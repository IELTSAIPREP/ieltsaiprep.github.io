town of Canterbury and the surrounding area.
The first site (S1) is situated in the countryside, to the north-east of the town 
centre. It is just outside the main housing area of the town and not far from the 
main road that links Sturry with Canterbury. It would therefore probably be in an 
ideal location for students coming from Sturry, which is only 5 kilometres away, 
and those who live on the east side of Canterbury. If there are students coming 
from Chartham, which is 7 kilometres to the south-west, they would be able to reach 
the school by taking the main road that runs south-west of Canterbury.
The second site (S2) is located in the town centre itself. There are advantages 
of this: it makes it practically equidistant for students coming from either Sturry 
or Chartham. Moreover, it would presumably be relatively easy for students who live 
in the housing area around the town centre to reach the school. However, because 
of the no traffic zone in the town centre, no parent would be able to drive their 
child all the way to school. This may make travel arrangements difficult for some 
parents.
