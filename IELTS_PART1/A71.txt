In IELTS Writing Task 1, one criterion the examiner will use to assess 
		your answer is Grammatical Range and Accuracy. 
		After your introductory sentence and your overview sentence, you need to 
		select relevant data to report on. To do this, you need to be able to accurately 
		describe numbers and figures.The two tables contain sales data for Fairtrade tea and 
pineapples in 2010 and 2015, in five nations of Europe.The first table shows low-level tea sales increasing in 
all five countries, albeit to widely varying degrees. In two places sales increased 
by the same small amount: 2.8-3 million euros in Germany, and 1.8-2 million in Norway. 
The increment was slightly larger in Netherlands, from 2-2.7 million euros. Meanwhile, 
in Austria sales doubled from 4-8 million euros. Finally, in France there was an 
enormous increase, from 2.5-21 million euros.In the second table, it is Austria which stands out as buying 
far more Fairtrade pineapples than the other four countries. The sales figures for 
Austria jumped from 16-48 million euros across these five years, while in France 
and Netherlands sales only grew from 2-6.5 and from 1.6-5 million euros respectively. 
Norway and Germany showed a different pattern, with falls in pineapple sales from 
2.8-2 and 3-1.9 million euros.Comparing the two tables, it is clear that in 2010 Fairtrade 
tea sales ranged from 1.8-4 million euros in these five countries, while pineapple 
sales also mostly clustered between 1.6 and 3 million euros, with Austria the outlier 
at a huge 16 million euros. By 2015, sales figures for both products had risen across 
the board, except for Norway and Germany which recorded drops in pineapple sales.
