in six types of educational institutions in the UK in 2010. It shows what percentage 
of teachers was male and what percentage was female.Women dominated the teaching profession in primary education, but less so at lower 
and upper secondary education. It was particularly true of nursery school, where 
the share of female teachers was above 95%. Similarly one-sided was the situation 
in primary school, where over 90% of teachers were also female.At secondary and upper secondary level this pattern was less pronounced, where there 
were nearly equal proportions of male and female teachers. On the other hand, male 
teachers outnumbered female teachers in high-level education, where the proportion 
of men was twice that for women.Overall, the higher the level of education, the more male teachers dominated, and 
the reverse occurred with respect to female teachers.
