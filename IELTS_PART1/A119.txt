the IELTS General Test in 2010. It shows separate scores for all four modules (Listening, 
Reading, Writing and Speaking), together with the overall band scores for students 
from four different language groups around the world.From an overall perspective, German speakers achieved 
the highest overall band score. Moreover, they scored the highest of all four language 
groups in three modules of the test (Listening, Writing, Speaking).French speaking candidates scored the second highest overall 
score of 6.7 out of 9, closely followed by Malay and Indonesian speakers. Although 
French speakers did not do so well in the Reading, Speaking and Listening modules 
compared to Indonesian and Malay speakers, there was a significant difference in 
their grades for the Writing module. These grades were high relative to Indonesian 
and Malay candidates. Surprisingly, Malay speakers, who achieved the second lowest 
result overall, achieved the highest results of all four language groups for the 
Reading module.As a final point, it is interesting to note that the scores 
for each module show that all students, on average, scored the highest marks for 
the Speaking module and the lowest marks for the Reading module.
