The line graph sets out the key motivations for people relocating to the capital of a specific country between 2000 and 2015.Moving for the purpose of study saw the greatest rise overall, with a jump of approximately 62,000. It rose considerably in two periods - from 2000 to 2005 (by 22,000), and then again from 2010 to 2015 (by 33,000), with a more gentle growth of around 7,000 in between.Elsewhere, the figure of people relocating for work began at 61,000 in 2000, then peaked at 92,000 in 2010 - the highest of any reason, in any year - before finishing as the joint-highest in 2015 (87,000 - on a level with those relocating in order to study). Notably, this category was the only one of the four that underwent a downturn.Turning to 'adventure', this category rose the most stably and steadily of all four categories, from 11,000 to 15,000 over the fifteen-year period. Meanwhile, the number of people relocating for 'family and friends' reasons climbed gently in the first five years (12,000 to 14,000), followed by an upswing to 22,000, before eventually levelling off at around 23,000 in 2015.
