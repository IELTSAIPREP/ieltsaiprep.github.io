Fuel type used to generate electricity (%)

The table shows different sources of fuel for producing electricity and their percentage use in five Asian countries in 2005. Generally, the five countries showed a significant difference in their patterns of consumption. Taking nuclear fuel first, Japan had the highest percentage at 49%, with South Korea second at 33%. In marked contrast, Thailand used no nuclear power at all. Turning to Coal and Lignite, Malaysia and Singapore used this to generate a large proportion of their electricity (61% and 42% respectively), a much higher percentage than the remaining countries.Regarding Petroleum products, Thailand produced 36% of its electricity from this source. In comparison, the other countries only generated 3% or less of their electricity from this fuel. However, Hydro and Wind reveal another pattern with South Korea producing almost half of its electricity (48%) this way (over twice as high as Thailand which had the second highest percentage at 19%). Finally, a significant amount was produced from other sources with three countries (Singapore, Thailand and Japan) generating around 40% of their electricity from other fuels. Overall, it can be seen that there was a significant variation in which fuels countries used to generate their electricity.
