The two diagrams show students' responses to the question 
of how good they are at managing their finances. The pie chart illustrates the ability 
of UK students to manage their finances and the table shows the proportion of students, 
by age, who think they are very organised at managing their finances.More than three-quarters of students (76%) believe they are either ‘very’ or ‘fairly’ 
organised financially, while one in five (20%) say they are not very organised in 
this area. Only 4% of students rate themselves as ‘not at all’ competent.The ability to manage one’s finances well would seem to develop with age and experience 
as older students are almost twice as likely to say they are ‘very’ organised than 
younger ones (31% of students aged 26 or over compared to just 17% for those aged 
up to 22).Overall, the findings suggest that students generally manage their finances well.
