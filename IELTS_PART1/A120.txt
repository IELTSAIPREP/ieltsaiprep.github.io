been relatively stable over the last two decades, although there were significant 
drops in numbers between 1987 and 1989 and again in 1992 and 1996. Since 2004 there 
has been an improvement in numbers of all species, although the graph shows a slight 
decrease in 2010.
In contrast, the population of Leatherback turtles has suffered a severe decline, 
particularly in 1988 when numbers fell dramatically. The rate of decline in the 
population appears to have slowed and it has remained relatively stable since 2009.
There was also a fall in the number of Green turtles of around 30% between 1984 
and 2002. The population increased slightly in 2010 but it had dropped again by 
2012.
It is only Olive Ridley turtles that have seen a steady increase in population over 
this period. Their numbers dropped slightly in 2007 and again in 2012 but the overall 
trend has been a positive one.
