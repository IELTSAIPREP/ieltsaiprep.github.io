There was a sharp increase in the number of students giving these services a good rating, particularly in the first five years: from 54 percent in 2005, to 81 percent in 2010, and 95 percent in 2015. There was also an overall improvement in ratings for teaching quality, though the increase was relatively small (74 percent in 2005 rising to 78 percent in 2015) and there was a decline in the interim (72 percent in 2010). There was also a fluctuation in attitudes to library resources, rising from 86 percent to 88 percent in the first five years and then falling by one percent in 2015. Good ratings for the university’s sports and social facilities were identical throughout, at 65 percent.
