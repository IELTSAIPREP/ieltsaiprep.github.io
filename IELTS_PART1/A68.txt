branches of a chain of restaurants in three different locations in Vancouver for 
the year 2016. It is evident that the best performer is the branch in Georgia Street, 
which with 854 transactions a day on average has at least 100 more transactions 
than Dunsmuir Street and more than double from Drake Street. Georgia Street is also 
ahead in terms of average transaction value (ATV), with $10.69 per transaction compared 
to Dunsmuir Street’s $5.61 and Drake Street’s $9.02.On average, eat-in and take-away transactions are almost 
equal in each restaurant, with take-away transactions ending slightly ahead in two 
of them. Drake Street is the only exception, with eat-in transactions surpassing 
take-away by 10.The table also gives us information about the most popular 
item in each branch, revealing that the eating habit of customers in each area are 
widely varied: Georgia Street’s best seller is Chicken Burger, while Dunsmuir Street’s 
customers favour Chicken Wings, and Drake Street’s customers prefer Chicken Pasta.Overall, it is clear that the Georgia Street’s branch is 
the company’s most profitable branch, with the highest number of transactions and 
ATV. Drake Street, on the other hand, lags far behind, despite the fact that its 
ATV is higher than Dunsmuir Street.
