The table shows details of participation in a variety of 
cultural activities over a year, according to the age of the participants.Overall, any performance, which includes dancing, singing, 
playing musical instruments and acting, had the highest level of participation, 
with 22% of respondents participating in the previous 12 months. By contrast, computer 
based activities had the lowest level of participation (6 per cent).People aged between 45 and 74 years old were most likely 
to undertake any activity to do with crafts (22 per cent), while performances were 
more likely to be participated in by those aged 16 to 24 (35 per cent). The differences 
between age groups were particularly marked in the case of visual arts and writing 
categories, where participation rates were around three times higher for younger 
people than for the older ones. It is clear from the evidence that age plays a significant 
role in the popularity of the cultural activities listed.
