The graph shows consumption of energy in the U.S. since 
1980 with projections through 2030.The historical trends show Petrol and Oil as the major sources of fuel, rising from 
35 quadrillion (35q) units used in 1980 to 42q in 2012. Despite some fluctuation 
between 1980 and 1995, there was a steady increase, which is expected to continue, 
reaching 47q in 2030.Consumption of energy from natural gas and coal followed a similar pattern over 
the period. From 20q and 15q respectively in 1980, gas showed an initial fall and 
coal a gradual increase, with the two fuels equal between 1985 and 1990. Consumption 
has fluctuated since 1990 but both now provide 24q. Coal consumption is projected 
to rise to 31q in 2030, whereas after 2014, natural gas is forecast to remain stable 
at 25q.In 1980, energy from solar/wind, nuclear, and hydropower was the least-used, with 
only 4q. Nuclear has risen by 3q, and solar/wind by 2. Since 2005, hydropower has 
fallen back to the 1980 figure. It is expected to remain approximately constant 
through 2030, while the others are projected to rise gradually after 2025.Overall, fossil fuels will remain the chief energy source for the US, with a little 
bit of hydroelectric, nuclear and a smidgen of renewables like wind and solar.
