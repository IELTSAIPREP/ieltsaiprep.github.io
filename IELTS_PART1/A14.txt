The two tables together give a snapshot of the reasons people choose to stop smoking and when they intend to give up.The main reason smokers give for stopping is for general health (71%), with financial considerations (31%) and the risk of smoking-related diseases (25%) being the next two most popular reasons. One fact to highlight from this table is that almost twice the percentage of heavy smokers cite present health problems as the reason compared to light smokers.According to the second table, the majority of smokers questioned (71%) intended to give up, with light smokers more inclined to stop (79%) than heavy smokers (60%). 35% of smokers said they were planning to give up within the next six months and only 12% said they were prepared to try within the following month. Although only 29% of smokers on average were unwilling to give up, heavy smokers were almost twice as unwilling to try as light smokers, which perhaps reflects the level of addiction in the former group.
