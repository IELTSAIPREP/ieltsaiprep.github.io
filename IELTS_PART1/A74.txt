tend to be different.According to the graph, the most popular sport among girls is netball, with participation 
rates reaching 25 per cent. A similar percentage of boys prefer soccer, which is 
clearly their favourite sport. Ten per cent of boys also enjoy playing cricket but 
hardly any girls take part in this game. While swimming is popular among both boys 
and girls, fewer boys participate in this sport - about 13 per cent compared to 
approximately 22 per cent of girls.Other sports such as tennis, basketball and martial arts have lower levels of
