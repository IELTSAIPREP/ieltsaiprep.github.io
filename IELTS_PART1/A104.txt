Read the following sample answer. Complete the answer by filling the gaps with the words in the box.The bar chart
	 
	the urbanization percentage of the world in 1950 and
	 
	this with the percentage in 2007 and the projected percentage for 2030.Between 1950 and 2030, the proportion of the world's population residing in 
	cities is expected to
	, 
	growing from 29% to 60%. However, this rate is less
	 
	in some continents than others.For example, 64% of the population of North America was urban in 1950, increasing 
	to 79% by 2007.
	, 
	just 15% of the African population was urban in 1950, but this rose to 37% by 2007. 
	This represents one of the
	 
	urbanization rates in the world, even though the percentage of Africans in urban 
	areas is still
	 
	than the world average.It is also clear from the graph that, urbanization in Latin America is projected 
	to be higher than Europe in 2030,
	 
	being lower in 1950.
