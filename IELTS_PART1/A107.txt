The first graph shows the trend in world population growth 
between 1800 and 2100, while the second graph gives predicted urban population figures 
for the next 25 years.The world population has experienced continuous growth since 1800. Between 1800 
and 1950, the population grew slowly from just under 1 billion to 2.5 billion people. 
After that, the growth rate increased and currently the figure is around 6.5 billion. 
Projections show a continued increase in population in the near future, but a steady 
decline in the population growth rate. The global population is expected to peak 
at 8.2 billion by 2050, and then decline to around 6.2 billion by 2100.The predictions also show that almost all urban population growth in the next 25 
years will occur in cities of developing countries. In developed regions, on the 
other hand, the urban population is expected to remain unchanged at about 1.3 billion 
people over the next two decades.The graphs show that the global population increase will not occur evenly throughout 
the world, but will be greater in some areas than others.
