The two maps show the main changes which have taken place in the town of Nelson between the year 2000 and today.In general, it appears that Nelson has become a much more modern city, with far more shopping and transport facilities.One interesting change is that a new trans line has been built, to connect the university with the town centre. In 2000, there wasn't any accommodation for students, but a hall of residence has been built near the university. Another striking change is that the old market in the west of the city has been knocked down to make way for new shops. A completely new covered market has also been built on the other side of town.If we look at the port area, it has been pedestrianized since 2000, and a range of entertainment facilities have been built, such as restaurants, bars and clubs. The north-east of the city used to be a green area, with lots of trees, but the trees have been cut down, and a new shopping complex has been constructed. A final interesting development has been the introduction of a bike-rental scheme in the city centre.
