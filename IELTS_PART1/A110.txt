and a heat exchanger. The reactor contains uranium fuel elements which are surrounded 
by graphite moderators and topped by charge tubes for loading fuel elements, and 
boron control rods. The whole reactor is contained in a pressure vessel surrounded 
by a concrete shield.From the reactor the hot gas flows through a duct into the heat exchanger which 
is outside the concrete radiation shielding. In the heat exchanger, steam is generated 
in a secondary loop. There a pipe brings in water which is heated to steam, and 
this then flows out to the turbo-alternator. Meanwhile the hot gas sinks to the 
bottom of the heat exchanger and passes through a gas blower which pushes it into 
a cool gas duct and back to the reactor.As can be seen, this is a continuous cycle that keeps the reactor from overheating, 
while carrying away the heat and steam, which will power the turbines.
