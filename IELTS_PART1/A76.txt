
The bar chart illustrates the percentage of people who hold a science qualification 
in Singapore and Malaysia. A prominent feature is that a significantly low percentage 
of people hold science qualifications, that is Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in 
science from university level studies in both countries. Less than 5% of people 
hold a qualification in science at Master’s degree level in both Singapore and Malaysia.There is a significant difference in the percentage of people holding science 
qualifications at Bachelor level between the two countries; while this number is 
20% in Singapore, in Malaysia it is a mere 10%. The percentage of people with school 
leaving exams in science is slightly higher in Malaysia than in Singapore. 35% of 
people in Malaysia have a science qualification at this level, whereas the number 
in Singapore is 5% lower. Finally, more than half the people in both countries hold 
no science qualification at all.
