changed since 2000 and how they will change in the future.In 2000, there were more people living in China than in 
India. The number of Chinese was 1.25 billion, while India's population was about 
1 billion. Between 2000 and 2010, there has been a 0.2 billion rise in the 
number of Indian citizens. Over the same period, China's population has increased 
by 0.1 billion to reach over 1.35 billion.According to the graph, the population in India will increase 
more quickly than in China, and experts say that by 2030, both countries will have 
the same population of 1.45 billion. After this, China's population is likely to 
fall slightly to 1.4 billion in 2050, while India's population will probably increase 
and reach 1.6 billion.Thus, over the 50-year period, India is going to experience 
steady growth in its population and it will overtake China. On the other hand, China's 
population will peak in 2030 and then begin to fall.
