The table shows the number of children born to women aged 
40–44 years in Australia in 1981, 1986, 1996 and 2001.In 1981, women aged 40-44 years were only marginally more likely to have had two 
children than three children (29% vs 27.4%) or four or more children (27.6%). Similarly, 
by 1986, women of this age were considerably more likely to have given birth to 
two children than three children (35.6% vs 27%) or four or more children (18.9%).In 1996 and 2006, the proportions of women aged 40-44 years who had given birth 
to two children were almost identical, though the proportions who had given birth 
to three children or to four or more children had decreased. In these more recent 
periods, women were more likely to have had two children than three or more children 
- a trend that was most marked in the most recent period (38.2% vs 24.6% in 1996; 
38.3% vs 21.5% in 2006).While two-child families now predominate, the number of women who had given birth 
to only one child increased progressively from 7.6% in 1981 to 13.2% in 2006.In 1981, similar proportions of women aged in their early forties were childless 
or had given birth to only one child (8.5% and 7.6% respectively). By 2006, 15.9% 
of women were childless and 13.2% had given birth to only one child.Overall, by age 40-44 years, the proportion of women who have had three or more 
children has fallen considerably since the 1980s, while the proportions who have 
had no children, or only one or two children has increased.
