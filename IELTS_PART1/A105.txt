Read the following sample answer. Complete the answer by filling 
the gaps with the correct form of the words in the box. Some words can be used more 
than once.The graph depicts waste recycling rates in the U.S.
	 1960 
	to 2011, in both percentage and tons.Between 1960 and 1970, the percentage of garbage being recycled annually remained 
	relatively  
	at just over 6%. It then 
 slightly over the next 15 years to 10.1% in 1985.On the other hand, the amount of garbage being recycled
	 during 
	the same period, from 5.6 million tons in 1960 to 16.7 million tons in 1985. Following 
	this  
	increase, the amount of waste material being recycled has risen
	 between 
	1985 and 2011 when it  
	at 86.9 million tons.Similarly, the recycling rate continued to grow
	 from 
	1985 to 1995, and then at a slower rate over the next 15 years until it
	 a peak 
	of 34.7% in 2011. However, this figure is still disappointing
	 to the 
	total amount of waste being recycled each year.
