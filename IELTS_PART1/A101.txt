The graph shows how the size and distribution of the UK's ageing population is 
likely to change over a 50-year period.
Overall, the proportions are predicted to increase in all UK countries. In 1985, 
15 per cent of the UK population was over 65, but by 2035, this will account for 
23 per cent of the total population.
A closer look at the data reveals that the ageing population is expected to rise 
more in some parts of the UK than in other. In 1985, Wales had the highest 
percentage of people aged 65 and over, at 16 per cent. The second-largest group 
could be found in England and the third in Scotland. Northern Ireland had lowest 
proportion, with 12 per cent aged 65 and over.
By 2035, Wales is still going to have by far the greatest percentage of over 
65s, with figures likely to reach 26 per cent. However, the biggest increases in 
this age group, relative to the rest of the population, are predicted to occur 
in Northern Ireland and Scotland. In Northern Ireland, for example, this figure 
will increase almost double to 23 per cent.
