The two diagrams show how electricity can be generated from 
the rise and fall of water caused by sea waves.
The process involves a structure which is mounted on the side of a cliff or sea 
wall. This structure consists of a large chamber. One end is open to the sea, and 
the other leads into a vertical column, which is open to the atmosphere. A turbine 
is installed inside this column and this is used to generate the electricity in 
two phases.
The first diagram indicates that when a wave approaches the device, water is forced 
into the chamber, applying pressure on the air within the column. This air escapes 
to atmosphere through the turbine, thereby producing electricity.
The second diagram illustrates the next part of the process when wave retreats. 
As the water level falls, the air from outside the column is sucked back in through 
the turbine. As a result, electricity continues to be generated. The turbine rotates 
only in one direction, regardless of the direction of the air flow.
In conclusion, we can see that this structure is useful as electricity is generated 
in both phases: entering and retreating of water.
