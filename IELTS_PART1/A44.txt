The bar chart illustrates the reasons men and women chose to work from home in 2019. Overall, saving money was the main reason for both males and females (45% and 42% respectively). In contrast, approximately a quarter of males put productivity as a reason, which was twice as high as the female response (24% and 11% respectively). For childcare, the pattern was different again with almost a quarter of females giving this reason compared to very few males (4%).The table shows the hours men and women worked from home in 2019. The vast majority of males worked over 30 hours per week (81%) contrasting with a minority of females (6%) doing similar hours. This pattern is reversed when examining the under ten hours category with almost three quarters of females working this amount compared to only 3% of males. The 10 to 30 hours per week category shows fewer marked differences.To sum up, it can be seen that men and women do not always give the same reasons for home working and, in general, men work longer hours from home.
