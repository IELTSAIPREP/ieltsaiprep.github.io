in five countries between 1995 and 2010. In 1995 over 70 million tourists visited 
the United States, more than twice as many as the next most popular destination 
shown, France. However, between 2005 and 2010 there was a decrease of approximately 
1,500,000 in the numbers going to the United States whereas there was an increase 
of nearly 20 million tourists visiting France. The result was that in 2010 the number 
of tourists arriving in the United States and France was almost equal at around 
90 million each.
