The chart shows changes in the share of international students 
who graduated from universities in different Canadian provinces over a period of 
5 years.
In 2001, this share had a relatively narrow range, from 3% in Ontario to 7.0% in 
New Brunswick. Nova Scotia had the second highest proportion at 6.5%. Five years 
later, the figures for most provinces had risen, with the exception of Alberta. 
There, the figures fell by 1% to just over 4%.
By 2006, some parts of Canada experienced a considerable increase in their share 
of international graduates. Growth in this share was especially strong in the case of New Brunswick, where the figures rose from 7% to 12%. The largest growth occurred in British Columbia, where it more than doubled to 11%.
Over this five-year period, changes in the proportion of international graduates 
have been very uneven across the provinces of Canada. However, New Brunswick remained 
the province with the highest percentage overall.
