students studying Computer Science at a UK university over three years. It also 
indicates whether they were home or international students. Compared to the number 
of home students, the number of international students was significantly smaller. 
Nevertheless, there was clear statistical growth in the latter group from 2010-2012. 
Furthermore, the number of female home students eventually overtook the number of 
males from the same group, reaching a high of 45 in 2012.The year 2011 saw the most dramatic developments; the number of male home students 
fell from just below 40 to 24 and the number of females rose from 32 to 44. There 
was also significant growth in the number of male students from overseas, climbing 
from 20 in 2010 to 39 in 2012. Overall, we can see an upward trend in the number 
of students at the university.
