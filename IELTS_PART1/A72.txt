them most happy. However, there are several striking differences.Firstly, let us look at the similarities. It is noticeable that for both younger 
and older people, the highest percentage says that achievement at work brings them 
most happiness: 31% for the younger age group and 32% for the older group. Doing 
hobbies is also very important for both groups: the second largest percentage of 
both age groups mention doing hobbies as making them most happy.Turning now to the differences, many younger people regard having a good appearance 
as extremely important: 18% of them state this brings them most happiness. This 
is followed by 15% who state that travel brings them happiness. Neither of these 
two factors is mentioned by older people. Instead, 20% of older people report that 
having financial security is most important to their happiness and 14% say they 
feel most happy when they are with their family.
