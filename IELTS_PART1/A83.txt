art gallery was the least popular.During the 1980s and 1990s there was a sharp increase in 
visitors to the pavilion from 28% to 48% and then the percentage gradually went 
down to 31% in 2010. The trend for the art gallery was similar to the pavilion. 
Visitors increased rapidly from 22% to 37% from 1980 to 1985 then gradually decreased 
to less than 10% over the next twenty-five years. The number of tourists who visited 
the Brighton Festival fluctuated slightly but in general remained steady at about 
25%. Visitors to the pier also fluctuated from 1980 to 2000 then rose significantly 
from 12% to 22% between 2000 and 2010.
