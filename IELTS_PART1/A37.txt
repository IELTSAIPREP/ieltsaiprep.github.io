The line graph shows the figures in millions for the migration of people from the countryside to cities in three different countries over the period 2000 to 2025, including future predictions. Overall, it is clear that the shift from rural communities towards urban metropolitan areas is upwards.All three countries began the period with similar numbers of urban migrants. Russia started with the most migrants (around 15 million) and over the period sees significant increases, particularly between 2010 and 2015 (around 42 to 70 million) with this upward trend predicted to continue (reaching approximately 86 million by 2025). Similarly, Iran after a slow start between 2000 and 2005 sees a dramatic rise in urban migration, and after 2015 is predicted to see an even more dramatic increase, surpassing Russia’s figures in 2020 reaching around 95 million by 2025. However, Indonesia bucks the trend somewhat. Whilst consistently steady between 2000 and 2020, its growth is far less dramatic than the other two countries (10 to 30 million). Furthermore, post 2020, it is predicted to level off at around 30 million.To sum up, while all three countries have seen growth up to 2015, only the figures for countries Russia and Iran are predicted to see continued growth up to 2025.
