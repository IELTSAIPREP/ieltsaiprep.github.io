The diagram shows the seven most important stages in the making of honey by bees. The process begins with the honey bees building a hive, and then finishes when the honey is ready to be collected and used.Firstly, the bees have to build a container. This is called a hive and it consists of many individually built cells. Next, the bees leave the hive in order to search for flowers. When they find a suitable flower, they collect the nectar from it, which is used to make honey.The nectar is then taken back to the hive where the production process can begin. First, it is put into cells. Then, following this, the nectar must be cooled down. In order to do this, the bees fan the nectar-filled cells with their wings. As a result, the nectar loses its water content and then finally, the honey is produced.
