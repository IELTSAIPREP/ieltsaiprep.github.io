Introduction -
		
		Explain briefly in your own words what the information shows. Give more 
		detail than the question and make
		
		comparisons where appropriate.

Main Body - Decide how to organise your paragraphs. For 
		example, in the model answer below,
		
		paragraph 2 is about 1940-1970,
		
		paragraph 3 is about 1970-2000 for Columbia and Yamhill, and
		
		paragraph 4 is about 1970-2000 for Washington. Use words such as
		
although and
		
however to make contrasts, and words such as
		
likewise to introduce similarities. Always include the actual 
		data you have been given. The
		
		final paragraph is not a conclusion in this type of task.The graph shows the increase in population of three 
counties, Columbia, Yamhill and Washington in the U.S. state of Oregon, between 
1940 and 2000. In 1940, Columbia had the lowest population of the three counties, 
at around 25,000. This compared with about 30,000 in Yamhill 
and approximately 75,000 in Washington.By 1970, Columbia’s population had risen to just 
under 36,000. Although this appears on the graph to be a gentle 
increase, it is in fact an increase of approximately 50%. Yamhill’s population also 
rose by nearly 50% between 1940 and 1970: from 30,000 to just under 45,000.
However, the greatest real increase was in Washington, where 
the population in 1970 had increased by approximately 75,000, to 125,000.The years 1970 to 2000 saw the populations of Columbia 
and Yamhill increase by approximately the same amounts that they had increased by 
the thirty years before. In 2000, Columbia’s population – at approximately 76,000 
– was triple what it had been in 1940. Likewise, Yamhill’s 
population, at around 90,000, was almost triple what it was in 1940.Although Washington’s increase in population between 
1940 and 1970 was large, its increase in the following thirty years was even sharper, 
rising from about 125,000 in 1970 to more than 240,000 in 2000.
