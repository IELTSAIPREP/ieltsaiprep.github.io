The chart compares population shares in various regions of the world with the distribution of wealth in these same regions. It can be seen that wealth is heavily concentrated in North America, Europe, and high income Asia-Pacific countries which together account for almost 90% of global wealth.Even though North America has only approximately 6% of the world's population, it boasts nearly 34% of global wealth. A similar situation can be seen in Europe, which has 15% of the global population but 30% of global wealth, and high income Asia-Pacific countries with 5% of the world's population but 24% of its wealth.In contrast, the overall share of wealth owned by people in Africa, China, India, and other lower income countries in Asia is considerably less than their population share, sometimes by a factor of more than ten. This is most striking in India, where 16% of the world's population own only 1% of the world's wealth and in China, which has the highest percentage of global population (24%) but only 3% of the world's wealth.
