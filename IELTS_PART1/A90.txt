across different retail sectors in Canada in the years 2005 and 2010. For three 
of the sectors, it is evident that over this time frame there was significant change 
in their proportion of online transactions.
At 35% we can see that electronics and appliance sector accounted for the majority 
of online sales in 2005, but this percentage had dropped to 30% by 2010. During 
the same five-year period, as an increasing number of people chose to purchase food 
and beverage online, we can see that transactions went from just 22% to 32%, making 
it the retail sector with the largest overall proportion of the online market.
In 2005, the home furnishing industry boasted an impressive 25% of the total online 
sales in Canada. However, by 2010, the figure had fallen considerably to 15%. Interestingly, 
online sales of video games eventually overtook sales of home furnishings, although 
video games still represented only 23% of the market.
