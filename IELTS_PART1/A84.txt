and females in employment in 6 broad categories, divided into manual and non-manual 
occupations. In general, a greater percentage of women work in non-manual occupations 
than work in manual occupations, and the reverse is true for men.In the non-manual occupations, while a greater percentage 
of working women than men are found in clerical-type positions, there is a smaller 
percentage of women than men employed in managerial and professional positions. 
The percentage of women employed in other non-manual occupations is slightly larger 
than the percentage of men in these occupations.In manual employment, the biggest difference between the 
two sexes is in the employment of craft workers, where males make up 24% of the 
workforce and females just 3%. Furthermore, the percentage of women working as general 
working as general labourers is very small, only 1%. There is not a great deal of 
difference between the percentage of men doing other forms of manual work (26%) 
and women in other manual work (27%).In summary, the two charts clearly show that women do not 
have the same access as men to certain types of employment.
