Source: Daily Telegraph - 8th Jan 2008Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) is a system that 
converts heat energy into the electric power using the temperature difference between 
surface seawater, which can be up to 29 degrees Celsius, and deep seawater, which 
is only 5 degrees Celsius.The main components of the system are an evacuated evaporation 
chamber, a turbine and a condensing chamber. The solar energy of the sun heats up 
the surface water and this warm water is introduced into the evacuated evaporation 
chamber, where it boils. As it boils, salt is deposited and water vapour is generated. 
This vapour then drives a turbine to generate electricity. After it powers the turbine, 
the water vapour enters the condensing chamber, which is cooled by the water from 
the depths of the ocean. The water vapour is condensed in this chamber, producing 
drinking water. Meanwhile, waste salt water is discharged into the ocean and the 
process can be repeated.
