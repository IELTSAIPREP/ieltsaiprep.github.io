The table provides information about different types of independent films released in the UK and the Republic of Ireland in 2012. It indicates how many films of different genres were made and also shows what proportion of total ticket sales was made by each kind of film.The table makes it very clear that there is no correlation between the number of films made in any category and the proportion of ticket sales earned by that sort of film. For example, the largest numbers of films were made in the Drama and Documentary categories - 35 of each of these were released. However, they earned only 8.3 and 2.9 percent of total ticket sales respectively.Comedy films were the most financially successful: 26 films, out of a total of 148, earned 45.4 percent of all the income from ticket sales. Another very successful type of film in 2012 was the biopic. Although only one of these was released, it accounted for 9.1 percent of ticket sales.
