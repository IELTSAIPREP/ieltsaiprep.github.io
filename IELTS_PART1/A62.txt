The bar chart shows the number of social networking sites visited by internet users in Canada in 2014 and in 2015. We can see from the data that, in general, there was a growing tendency to use more than one site.Although just over one fifth of internet users did not use any social networking sites in either of the years, the proportion in this category decreased from 22 percent in 2014 to 21 percent in 2015. In both years the highest proportion of users in any group fell into the ‘One site’ category. However, this group declined sharply from 36 percent in 2014 to 28 percent in 2015.In contrast, the numbers who reported using two sites, three sites, four sites and five sites all grew over the period analysed. In both years the proportion of internet users fell as the number of social networking sites increased, with only 2 percent using five sites in 2014 compared to 4 percent in 2015.
