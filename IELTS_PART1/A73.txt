and 2015. It also indicates future projections for 2025. According to the data, 
it seems likely that international tourism will become the dominant industry, although 
dairy exports will remain strong. In 2005, we can see that tourism was the greatest 
exports earner of the three industries, with revenue standing at just over $6 billion.This figure has increased slightly, so that now, in 2015, it has reached almost 
$7 billion. It is estimated that international tourism will continue to grow, so 
that by 2025, it will be earning around $8 billion for the country. In 2000, dairy 
exports were worth around $5 billion, but since then there has been a dramatic increase, 
and sales for this year are approximately $8 billion. Experts are predicting that 
exports in this area may fall slightly, so a figure of $7.5 billion is expected 
for 2025. Meat products are the third key industry in Someland, but sales have dropped 
since 2000 and now stand at $3.5 billion. It is expected that sales will continue 
to decrease in the future.
