topic of the graph, explains what the graph shows and outlines overall trends or 
patterns.)
The graph shows pollution levels in London between 1600 and 2000. It measures smoke 
and sulphur dioxide in micrograms per cubic metre. According to the information, 
the levels of both pollutants formed a similar pattern during this period, but there 
were always higher levels of sulphur dioxide than smoke in the atmosphere.(2nd paragraph describes the trends 
in more detail and illustrates these using data from the graph.)
In 1600, pollution levels were low, but over the next hundred years, the levels 
of sulphur dioxide rose to 700 micrograms per cubic metre, while the levels of smoke 
rose gradually to about 200 micrograms per cubic metre. Over the next two hundred 
years the levels of sulphur dioxide continued to increase, although there was some 
fluctuation in this trend. They reached a peak in 1850. Smoke levels increased a 
little more sharply during this time and peaked in 1900 at about 500 micrograms. 
During the 20th century, the levels of both pollutants fell dramatically, though 
there was a great deal of fluctuation within this fall.(Final paragraph draws a simple 
conclusion from the data.)
Clearly air pollution was a bigger problem in London in the early 20th century than 
it is now.
